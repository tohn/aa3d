Ben Levitt has contributed following changes:

 - commented the code a little so curious people can more
   easily learn a little about stereograms
 - improved the default character-set
 - improved randomization of line offsets to avoid 2 lines
   starting near the same spot
 - added a randomizing seed command line argument
 - fixed bug in the output: at borders between 2 different
   depths, sometimes a character that was supposed to be at the depth
   of the background looks like it's at the depth of the foreground. 
   This was fixed by detecting when this happens, and replacing the
   character with a random character.  This doesn't cause any visual problem,
   because these characters on the bottom side of such a depth border would
   only be seen by one eye in the real world, so it doesn't need to match up
   with any other character.
